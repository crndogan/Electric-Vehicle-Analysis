# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle Population Data published by the Washington State Department of Licensing.  
The goal is to explore trends in EV adoption, vehicle age, EV types, and the relationship between price and range.

## Methods
- Cleaned and transformed the dataset (renamed columns, created EV age, price categories, eligibility flags).  
- Performed exploratory data analysis with visualizations:  
  - Bar chart: Top EV makes by count  
  - Histogram: Vehicle age distribution  
  - Scatter plot: EV range vs. base price  
  - Pie chart: EV type distribution  
  - Line chart: Top 10 makes by average range  

## Example Visualizations
- EV makes by count  
- EV age distribution  
- EV price vs. range  
- EV type distribution  
- Top 10 makes by average range  

(Plots are included in the report and R script)
