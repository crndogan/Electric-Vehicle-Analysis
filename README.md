# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis
Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis in R

## Overview
This project analyzes the **Electric Vehicle Population Data** published by the Washington State Department of Licensing.  

The goal is to explore trends in electric vehicle adoption, vehicle age distribution, EV types, and relationships between price and range.


## Methods
Key steps in the analysis:
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Renamed columns for clarity
   - Created new fields (EV age, price range, CAFV eligibility, brand field, range quality)
   - Converted categorical variables to factors  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Top EV makes by count (bar chart)
   - Vehicle age distribution (histogram)
   - Average EV range vs. base price (scatter plot)
   - Distribution of EV types (pie chart)
   - Top 10 makes by average range (line chart)

3. **Exported Data**
   - Clean dataset â†’ `Ev_Data.csv`
   - EV counts by state â†’ `Df1_EvState.csv`
   - EV type distribution â†’ `Df2_EvType.csv`
   - Average price vs. range â†’ `Df3_EvPrice.csv`
